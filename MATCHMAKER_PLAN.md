# Toronto Jewish Matchmaker - Product & Marketing Plan

## Executive Summary

An AI-powered matchmaking platform designed specifically for the Toronto Jewish community.

This creates a powerful growth engine where every new member helps us find more compatible people in the community.

**Target Market:** ~10,000 young professionals in the Toronto Jewish community  
**Launch Focus:** Toronto Jewish community (all religious backgrounds)

     - Lifestyle preferences
     - Education and career goals
     - Family background and expectations
     - Geographic proximity

     - Brief compatibility highlights

5. **Connection**
   - Matched individuals connect directly
   - Platform facilitates introduction, conversation happens offline

### AI-Powered Prospecting (Unique Feature)

**How AI Prospecting Works:**
1. **After a member signs up**, the AI analyzes their profile and creates matching criteria
2. **AI searches the internet** (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, professional networks) for people matching those criteria

   - Location (Toronto/GTA)
   - Age range compatibility
   - Jewish community indicators (synagogue mentions, Jewish organizations, cultural markers)
   - Professional background and education
   - Interests and lifestyle indicators

6. **If they sign up**, the algorithm confirms compatibility and both parties are matched and notified

#### 3. AI-Powered Prospecting & Outreach

**Core Concept: AI Proactive Match Finding**
Our AI doesn't just match people who sign up - it actively searches the internet (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, professional networks) to find potential matches for existing members. When it finds someone who matches a member's profile, it reaches out with a personalized DM.

**How It Works:**
1. **Member signs up** and fills out profile
2. **AI analyzes profile** and creates matching criteria
3. **AI searches internet/social media** for profiles matching those criteria
4. **AI identifies potential matches** based on:
   - Location (Toronto/GTA)
   - Age range
   - Jewish community indicators
   - Professional background
   - Interests and lifestyle indicators
5. **AI generates personalized DM** mentioning that they've been flagged as a potential match
6. **Outreach sent** with link to sign up
7. **If they sign up and match**, both parties are notified

**Example Flow:**
- Sarah (28, lawyer, Toronto) signs up
- AI searches Instagram/LinkedIn for: Jewish professionals, 26-32, Toronto, compatible interests
- Finds David (29, doctor, Toronto) who matches Sarah's criteria
- AI sends DM: "Hi David! This is Elizabeth! We are building out a free Jewish matchmaker for the Toronto community and our AI flagged your profile. We have a member who our AI thinks you'd love!"
- David signs up, algorithm confirms match, both get notified

**Tools to Consider:**
- **Phantombuster** or **Apify:** Instagram/LinkedIn automation and scraping
- **Lemlist** or **Outreach.io:** Email automation and personalization
- **ChatGPT/Claude:** Generate personalized outreach messages and profile analysis
- **Buffer/Hootsuite:** Social media scheduling
- **Custom AI system:** Profile matching and prospecting algorithm

**Automation Strategy:**
- AI continuously searches for new potential matches as members join
- Personalize outreach messages using AI (but maintain human touch)
- Schedule follow-ups for non-responders
- Track engagement and responses
- A/B test messaging
- Monitor and refine matching criteria based on success rates

**Important:** 
- Always personalize and add human touch - don't make it feel robotic
- Respect privacy and platform terms of service
- Be transparent about how you found them ("our AI flagged your profile")
- Make it feel exciting and personalized, not spammy

### How to Set Up AI for Automated Outreach

#### Step-by-Step Setup Guide

**Phase 1: Profile Analysis & Criteria Extraction**

1. **When a member signs up:**
   - Extract key matching criteria from their profile:
     - Age range (e.g., 26-32)
     - Location (Toronto/GTA)
     - Profession/industry
     - Religious observance level
     - Interests and hobbies

     - Values and lifestyle

2. **Use AI to create search criteria:**
   - **Tool:** ChatGPT/Claude API or custom script
   - **Input:** Member profile data
   - **Output:** Structured search criteria with keywords, hashtags, and filters

**Example:**
```
Member: Sarah, 28, Lawyer, Toronto, Conservative, Loves hiking, UofT grad
AI generates search criteria:
- Location: Toronto, GTA
- Age: 26-32
- Keywords: lawyer, attorney, legal, UofT, University of Toronto
- Hashtags: #torontojewish #jewishprofessional #torontolawyer
- Interests: hiking, outdoor activities

   ```

3. **Threshold:** Only proceed if match score > 70

**Phase 4: Automated Message Generation**

**Setup:**
1. **Use AI to personalize messages:**
   - **Tool:** ChatGPT/Claude API
   - **Input:** Member profile + discovered profile + base template
   - **Output:** Personalized DM/message

2. **Message Generation Prompt:**
   ```
   Generate a personalized Instagram DM for this person:
   
   Their name: [Name]
   Their profile highlights: [Key info from their profile]
   Our member they match: [Brief member info]
   
   Use this template but personalize it:
   "Hi [Name]! This is Elizabeth! We are building out a free Jewish matchmaker 
   for the Toronto community and our AI flagged your profile. We have a member 
   who our AI thinks you'd love! Single and looking for your match? Fill out
