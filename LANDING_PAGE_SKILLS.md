# Landing Page Best Practices

These are the guidelines to follow when creating or refining any landing page. Use this doc to ensure consistency, clarity, and persuasion.

---

## Page Structure

Follow this recommended layout:

1. Hero / Above-the-Fold  
   - Big headline (benefit-driven, simple)  
   - Subheadline (supporting details)  
   - Primary CTA  
   - Optional hero media (image/video)  

2. Unique Value Proposition ("We Source With AI", etc.)  
   - Short, clear statement what makes us different  

3. How It Works / Steps  
   - Plain list of steps (no heavy graphics or boxes unless necessary)  

4. Social Proof  
   - Trust badges, testimonials, user logos, stats  

5. Secondary CTA  
   - Remind people where to go next, encourage the action  

6. Footer  
   - Links, legal, subtle styling  

---

## Copy & Voice

- Headline: focus on outcome, not features  
- Subheadline: specific, concise  
- CTAs: action words ("Start", "Join", "Claim"), benefit-focused  
- Tone: confident, helpful — **not** desperate  
- Avoid jargon, vague promises  

---

## Visual Design

- Colors: professional & subtle; avoid overly vibrant contrasts in footer/header  
- Buttons: whole button styled, consistent shadows, no underlines by default  
- Dividers: clear and visually distinct between sections  
- Layout: clean, uncluttered, easy-to-scan  

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Multiple CTAs conflicting with each other  
- Overly-humorous copy that undercuts confidence  
- Distracting overlays or decorative elements (e.g. hearts) that don't add value  
- Too much color vibrancy in non-primary areas  

---

## Example "How It Works" Section Rewrite

Instead of using boxed graphics or multiple stylized cards:

> **How It Works**
> 1. We source matches using AI based on your profile and preferences.  
> 2. You review curated profiles.  
> 3. We connect you with someone compatible when you say you're ready.

## When to Use This Skill

- For reviewing design drafts or copy versions  
- When fixing feedback about styling, tone, layout

## Output Format When Applying These Guidelines

- A design review checklist (yes/no)  
- Example copy + proposed replacement if something doesn't match  
- Screenshots or links to sections that need visual tweaks
