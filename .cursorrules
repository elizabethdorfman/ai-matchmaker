# Cursor Rules for Web Development

## Browser-First Development
**ALWAYS view web applications in the browser first before making assumptions about functionality or debugging issues.**

When working on web development projects:
1. **Check the browser** - Use browser tools to navigate to the application and see what's actually happening
2. **Take screenshots** - Capture visual state to understand UI issues
3. **Check console** - Review browser console for errors and warnings
4. **Verify functionality** - Test features in the actual browser environment

This ensures you understand the real user experience and can debug issues more effectively.
